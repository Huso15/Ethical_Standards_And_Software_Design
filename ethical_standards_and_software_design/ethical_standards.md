# Legal and Ethical Standards

## Scenario 1 - Banking Corp

## *Legal Concerns*

1) Data Privacy Laws: BankingCorp might be violating data privacy laws depending on the jurisdiction. Sharing customer information, especially for targeted marketing by a third party, could be illegal without explicit customer consent.
2) Fair Lending Practices: Some countries have regulations on fair lending practices. Targeting customers in financial hardship with payday loans could be seen as predatory lending.

## *Ethical Concerns*

1) Exploiting Vulnerability: Targeting customers struggling financially takes advantage of their situation and could push them further into debt.
2) Loss of Trust: Customers may feel BankingCorp prioritizes profits over their well-being by partnering with a payday loan company, especially after negative publicity.
3) Transparency: Not being upfront about the partnership erodes trust and is unfair to customers who might not understand how their data is being used.

## *Recommendations*

1) Obtain Explicit Opt-In: Get clear and informed consent from customers before sharing their data for marketing purposes.
2) Explore Alternative Solutions: Instead of payday loans, BankingCorp could offer financial hardship programs, debt management tools, or direct customers to credit counseling services.
3) Transparency and Public Trust: Be transparent about the partnership, even if the loan company has negative publicity. Explain the benefits to customers and the measures taken to protect their data.
4) Data Anonymization: BankingCorp could explore anonymizing customer data before sharing it with the loan company, making it impossible to identify individuals.

## Scenario 2 - Treasure Hunters

## *Legal Concerns*

1) Generally, this proposal wouldn't raise major legal issues, as long as in-app purchases are clearly marked and follow the app store's guidelines.

## *Ethical Concerns*

1) Shifting Gameplay Focus: Transitioning from daily new maps to a system where players need to unlock them might frustrate players who enjoyed the rapid content flow.
2) Pay-to-Win Elements: Selling hints for real money introduces a "pay-to-win" element, potentially giving players who spend an advantage and diminishing the challenge for those who don't.
3) Predatory Practices: Multi-buy discounts for hints could be seen as encouraging excessive spending, especially if the game is targeted towards children.

## *Recommendations*

1) Balance Content and Monetization: Maintain a steady stream of free maps alongside unlockable ones to keep players engaged without feeling forced to pay.
2) Alternative Monetization: Consider offering cosmetic upgrades or bonus content (like additional puzzles) for purchase instead of gameplay-affecting hints.
3) Transparency and Fairness: Clearly disclose the cost of hints and avoid manipulative tactics like limited-time offers or purposely creating overly difficult puzzles to pressure purchases.
4) Rewarding Gameplay: Make hints purchasable with points earned in-game, allowing dedicated players to progress without spending real money.

## Scenario 3 - friends.com

## *Legal Concerns*

1) Data Privacy Laws: Sharing user location data for targeted advertising requires compliance with data privacy laws. Users need to be informed about data collection and have clear opt-in/opt-out options.

## *Ethical Concerns*

1) Bait and Switch: Limiting core features (profile views, daily matches) in the free tier and then bombarding users with "trial periods" and upgrade ads could be seen as manipulative.
2) Limiting Social Connection: Capping matches for free users hinders the core purpose of the platform - making connections. This could disproportionately affect new users who need the service most.
3) Privacy Concerns: Sharing location data for targeted advertising raises privacy concerns, especially if users aren't fully aware or comfortable with it.

## *Recommendations*

1) Freemium Model Balance: Keep core features like profile viewing and a reasonable number of daily matches free. Offer premium features like more detailed profiles, advanced filters, and boosted visibility for an additional fee.
2) Focus on Value Proposition: Emphasize the benefits of premium membership without resorting to pressure tactics. Showcase success stories or highlight features that genuinely enhance the user experience.
3) Transparency and User Control: Be transparent about data collection and targeted advertising. Allow users to control their location settings and opt-out of targeted ads.
4) Consider Alternative Revenue Streams: Explore alternative revenue streams like offering local businesses premium ad placement options without compromising user privacy.
